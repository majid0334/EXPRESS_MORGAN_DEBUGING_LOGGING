# KodKampus
# In order to try out the you need to have moongoose and mySql and also add learningpaths to your moongosse database
I created a log in system using brcyprt and passport you can also create accounts. Each account have a learningpath/course
I have a proggress system how far did each user have come on each course and users can see other users how they are in their courses
Currenlty it is server side rendering because ui is build with handlebars
